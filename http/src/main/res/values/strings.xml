    <string name="about_text"><![CDATA[This is a small tool that can turn your mobile phone into an HTTP server, so that you can send API commands (URL Scheme) from the LAN computer to trigger various actions of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sarasarasa.lifeup">LifeUp application</a>.
<br/><br/><b># It can be used in the following scenarios (requires additional development of Web, Python, etc.):</b>
<br/>1. Judging the usage time on the computer, the amount of text input, and the drawing time to trigger the completion of tasks, rewards or punishments of the LifeUp application.<br/>And everything you can do with computer programming!
<br/>
<br/>2. Implement a simple web page version to create tasks from the computer web page.
<br/>
<br/>3. Infinite other possibilitiesâ€¦
<br/>
<br/><b># To-do:</b>
<br/>At present, it still lacks a query interface, so it can only focus on triggering actions, and cannot query the task list and attribute experience value on the mobile phone.
<br/>
<br/><b># Open Source:</b>
<br/>This is an open source project <a href="https://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp">https://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp</a>, welcome to contribute code to us.]]></string>
